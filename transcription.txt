so making Drone is so easy if you have money right but let's break this me today welcome to Rizwan ideas I am studying in exciting video series about building a Drone on budget using our favourite awards in this first part of video we create a custom 6 channel transmitter and receiver perfect for controlling bronze robots or even RC cars this transmitter and receiver setup comparable to a commercial price system but way more budget friendly and in the next video
please set up to build our very own arduino power zone so let's get started that is everything you need to build a transmitter and the receiver communication setup and eventually the Drone for this video we focusing on this part and this additional components will come into play in the next video when we assemble the Drone itself but for now let's start by building transmitter we start with zero PCB and 2 joystick models one module will control throttle and your what other hand is wrong and pitch movement all the components on the zero PCB
where is the connection diagram we follow it simple and straight forward so now everything together all the connections are complete the front side looks very clean and professional its mass of wire not very professional looking but don't worry I have a solution
ldm 365 and LCM student it is incredible platform for inspiring electronics designers with LCM student lab you can get free access to 2 powerful tools ldm designer of world class PCB design software test professional used to create advanced circuits and systems and LCM 365 cloud based collaboration tool that lets you teach your designs and work with your team no matter where you are this is fantastic opportunity to learn how to design PCB is like a pro while earning a certificates recognised by leading industries in India it is doesn't stop there and provide PCB design courses they are
university level courses that teach you A to Z of Electronics designs certifications and advanced tools you can get free access to tool like a power analyser by key slide helping your design and a circuits even the greater Precision I personally use ATM designer to create professional grade PCB like this one and I showcase this next part of the video it is user friendly packed with advanced features and make turn your ideas into reality so much easier so if you are serious to about learning PCB design and standing out in the industry head to the link in the description to get
with ATM student life after I designed the PCB I will order it from next pcb.com and in the next video we will use this professional design PCB is for a Drone project now let's get to the build let's move on to the programming transmitter for this you will need nrf24 library the codes are available in the video description select the arduino nano board upload the code and we could go together all the display is working perfectly and the transmitter part is ready let's move on to building the receiver or let others 24
3.3 volt adaptor and few bucks trips the nrf24 modules operates at 3.3 volts to safely connect them to arduino Nano which use of five words I am using this nrf24 adaptor board they not only regulate the voltage but also ensure the stable operation using this circuit diagram we connect everything together you can find the diagram in the video description on my website it is one side yes.com now the receiver is ready and the pinout is same as a commercial transmitter
Manish roll peach photo your auxiliary one and auxiliary to now let's program the receiver had you can see I had failure mode which is gradually reduce the throttle if the wrong goes out of the range this ensure the smooth landing and about grasses upload the code and now are receiver is ready but weight is not working here to troubleshoot 100 capacitive between the nrf BCC and grounding this reduce noise and improve stability
how its work but there is still not visible delay which makes unstable for flying Drone the problem lies with all the display the arduino Nano 8 bit AVR microcontroller struggle to process both oled and nrf task in real time so I disconnect the wallet and the program the arduino but don't worry the final code is available in the description and now it is working perfectly super responsive and ready for action I also
3D printed case for transmitter if you are interested to building like this one you can download the 3D files from my website is one side yes.com it is great way to make your projects look professional that's it for this part of video in the next part we use this custom transmitter and receiver to build a fully function arduino power drawn one object when I upload the part 2 and like this video to support our channel thanks again 365 for sponsoring this video
